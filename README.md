--------


Setting up the environment
------------

1. Install `poetry`: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
2. Create an environment with `poetry install`
3. Run `poetry shell`
4. To add a new package run `poetry add <package>`. Don't forget to commit the lockfile.
5. To run unit tests for your service use `poetry run pytest` or simply `pytest` within `poetry shell`.
